This is the Dengo package, designed to be a meta-solver for chemical reaction
networks and cooling processes.  The purpose of this is to provide a simple and
maintainable way of defining microphysical solvers for updating the chemical
and thermodynamic state of fluids in astrophysical simulations.  It has been
designed to output a C solver which can call external solver libraries, as well
as affiliated reaction rate tables.

Dependencies:
    CHIANTI -- Atomic Database for astrophysical spectroscopy
    
        - Download from http://www.chiantidatabase.org/download/CHIANTI_7.1_data.tar.gz
	    - Place in unique directory before untarring (it doesn't have a containment folder)
        - Need to set special environment variable, XUVTOP
            (example: 'setenv XUVTOP /path/to/CHIANTI' )

    ChiantiPy -- ChiantiPy is the Python interface to the CHIANTI atomic database

        - Download from http://sourceforge.net/projects/chiantipy/
        - run 'python setup.py install' in ChiantiPy directory
    
    Sundials/CVode -- Suite of ODE solvers

        - Download from https://computation.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/cvode
        - and set the envirnoment variable
        - run 'python setup.py install' in ChiantiPy directory
